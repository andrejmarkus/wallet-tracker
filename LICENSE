                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
network-managed software remains free and open for all.

The GNU General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

By contrast, our licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. For most software, the GNU General Public
License is a copyleft license, which means that derivative works must
themselves be free in the same sense. It is designed to care for the
rights of all users of a program or other work, and, specifically, to
provide a distinct version of the license for the case of software
on a network, providing for a way for users to interact with that
software through a network to receive the source code of the software.

The standard GNU General Public License is not appropriate for such
situations, as it does not require that a user who interacts with the
software through a network can receive the source code of that software.
The GNU Affero General Public License is designed to correct this.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
